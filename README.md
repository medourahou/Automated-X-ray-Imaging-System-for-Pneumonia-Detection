# An Automated X-ray Imaging System for Pneumonia Detection

<h2> 1. Pneumonia definition</h2>
Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.
<h2>2. Pneumonia symptoms</h2>
The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days.

Common symptoms of pneumonia include:
<ul>
<li>a cough – which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown, or blood-stained mucus (phlegm) </li>
 <li> Difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting</li>
  <li>rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>high temperature</li>
  <li>feeling generally unwell</li>
  <li>sweating and shivering</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
  <li>chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing</li>
 <li>...</li>
  </ul>
<h2>3. Project description</h2>
In this project, I present a system to diagnose and detect <b>Pneumonia</b> from a human Chest based upon an X-Ray images dataset (X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body).<br>
To analyze and process these images so I build a CNN model to train and test on the dataset, then I adjust the performance of the model by providing Transfer Learning using VGG16.
<h2>4. Dataset</h2>
The dataset's name is Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) got from Kaggle, here is the link <a href="http.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia">link</a> .<br>
